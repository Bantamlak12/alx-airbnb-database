# SQL JOIN Project

This project aims to teach complex queries with Joins.

## INNER JOIN
- Retrieves records that have matching values in both tables.


## LEFT JOIN
- Retrieve all records from the left table and matched records from the right table. Unmatched right table records will be `NULL`.

## FULL OUTER JOIN
- Retrieves all records when there is a match in either table. Unmatched values will show as `NULL`.

> Note: FULL OUTER JOIN: may not be supported in MySQL. Use a combination of LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN with UNION.
